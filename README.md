# Community Sleep Project

This is my Community Sleep Project for course, CAMS-UA 170.

I have created an interactive game written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is a [screen recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Niof8YARUdK4Z8nNj87_jt4y89CI35y/view?usp=sharing) for the game.
You can play with the project using [this link](https://yuntingkao.github.io/)
